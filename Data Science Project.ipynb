    "Arithmetic expressions are fundamental in mathematics and programming. They involve mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In this section, we'll explore some common arithmetic expressions with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to get a sum. The addition operator is represented by the plus sign (+).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "2 + 3  #Result: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtraction is the process of finding the difference between two numbers. The subtraction operator is represented by the minus sign (-).\n",
    "10 - 5  # Result: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication is the process of repeated addition or scaling. The multiplication operator is represented by the asterisk (*).\n",
    "\n",
    "4 * 5  # Result: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Division is the process of dividing one number by another to get a quotient. The division operator is represented by the forward slash (/).\n",
